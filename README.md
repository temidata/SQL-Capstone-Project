# SQL-Capstone-Project
# Data Sourcing
# Problem Statement:
Peradventure you’re a Data Analyst working for the charity,
Education for All. You have been asked by the Head
of Fundraising to present the data on donor insights
and donation rates.

Within the Fundraising team, your objectives are to:
• Increase the number of donors in your database
• Increase the donation frequency of your donors.
• Increase the value of donations in your database.
In two weeks your team is having a fundraising
strategy meeting for the following year, and you need
to present insights from the donation data to inform
your fundraising strategy and increase donations.

# Introduction: The Story
This project involves presenting data insight of currently received donations from different
donors. Two
data sets from a charity organization (Education for All) were provided by the 10Alytic team,
namely
‘Donation data’ and ‘Donor data’, both of which contain different pieces of information related
to donors’ biodata and their donations.
In addition, the business problem is to devise strategies of increasing funds for Education for All
charity
organizations, using the provided data. Specifically, the tasks include increasing the number of
donors,
increasing the donation frequency, and the donation amount itself.
All data were imported into the SQL tool (sqliteonline.com) using Postgres IDE and were
queried with different codes to
obtain insights necessary to increase donations. Importantly, wealth makers (real estates),
business
tycoons, loyal donors (daily-weekly-monthly), and people with luxurious lifestyles (exotic cars)
were
identified using various queries, while redundant and uneducated people who understand a
second
language provided a complete insight into possible targets of donation increment. Gender did not
make
any difference and donors were higher from certain states than others.
Results showed that a low level of education and ability to speak a second language negatively
affected
donation. Almost all redundant donors did not have a university degree and consequently did not
understand why they should support the charity cause. In addition, most of them may have
preferred to receive correspondence from the organization from their second language and
therefore did not respond well to emails and honor invitations.

The fundraising team should consider sending emails to redundant donors in their second
language.

# Root Cause Analysis Process

Problem: Find ways of increasing donors, donation frequency, and amount for education
Why: Fewer donations, few donors, and redundancy in donation
Why: A language barrier, wrong audience, and lack of motivation
Why: Some donors understand a second language, have little education
Why: Nature of their work/business, successful in other careers, apart from education

# Insight from Analysis

 1. Total donors were 1000 of which 508 were females while 492 were males. The total sums of
donations were calculated based on gender and it was found that a total of
$121457 (48%) donors were female, using the sequel code below, while male donors were
$127628 (52%) donors, making a total of $249085. The following SQL queries were used
# Query :Total donation and number of donations by gender
SELECT gender, SUM(donation), COUNT(donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
GROUP BY gender;

Total donation amount
SELECT SUM(donation)
From "Donation_Data";

# 2. The total donations per state were estimated, and values were accessed in the SQL queries
below
The top 10 states that donated the least (Fig.1) are Wyoming ($258), South Dakota ($401), North
Dakota ($651), Alaska ($734), West Virginia ($793), South Carolina ($819), New Hampshire
($841), Hawaii ($875) and Montana ($1009). While the 10 states that donated the most (Fig. 2)
are California ($30,264), Texas ($24097), Florida ($20562), New York ($14759), Virginia
($10750), Illinois ($8674), District of Columbia ($8376), Tennessee ($8316), Georgia ($8046)
and Ohio ($6876)

# Query Top 10 States with least amount of donations
SELECT state, SUM(donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY SUM(donation)ASC
LIMIT 10 ;


# Query Top 10 States with the highest amount of donations
SELECT state, SUM(donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY SUM(donation)DESC
LIMIT 10 ;


# 3. Donors donated at different frequencies. The donation frequencies are; Once ($32,666),
Weekly ($31,645), Daily ($29,249), Yearly ($35,266), Seldom ($30,650), Monthly ($26,870),
Often ($28,476), and Never ($34,263).
# Query Total donation by frequency of donation
SELECT SUM("Donation_Data".donation),"Donor_Data".donation_frequency
FROM "Donation_Data"
JOIN "Donor_Data"
ON "Donation_Data".ID = "Donor_Data".ID
GROUP BY donation_frequency;

# 4. Total numbers of donors who work in one of the 12 different job fields. They are Business
Development (94), Human Recourses (93), Engineering (93), Product Management (90),
Training (84), Research & Development (84), Sales (83), Accounting (80), Services (80),
Support (79), Marketing (74), and Legal (66)
# Query Donors who work in Human Resources donated more money ($23,060) while those that work in Legal ($17309) donated the least.
SELECT job_field, SUM(donation), COUNT(donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
GROUP BY job_field;


# 5. Over ~50% (586) of the total numbers of donors donated over $200 with a total donation of
$205,892 and ~41% (411) of donors donated less than $200 with a total donation of $24,593
while ~1% (3) donors donated $200 with a total donation of $600.

# Query
SELECT SUM(donation), COUNT(donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
WHERE donation >$200;

# Query
SELECT SUM(donation), COUNT(donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
WHERE donation <$200; 

# Query
SELECT SUM(donation), COUNT(donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
WHERE donation = $200; Fig.6

# 6. Donation by donors’ car. Top 10 cars driven by donors that made the highest donation are;
Ford ($22,706), Chevrolet ($19,875), Toyota ($14,123), GMC ($10,145), Mitsubishi ($10,001),
Dodge ($9,479), Pontiac ($9,331), Honda ($9,201), Honda ($9,201), Volkswagen ($8,964) and
BMW ($8,608).

# Query
SELECT "Donor_Data".car, SUM("Donation_Data".donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
JOIN "Donor_Data"
ON "Donation_Data".id = "Donor_Data".id
GROUP BY "Donor_Data".car
ORDER BY SUM("Donation_Data".donation)DESC
LIMIT 10;

# 7. Donors who speak a second language by donation frequency.
# Query
SELECT "Donor_Data".donation_frequency, COUNT("Donor_Data".second_language),
SUM("Donation_Data".donation)
FROM "Donation_Data"
JOIN "Donor_Data"
ON "Donation_Data".id = "Donor_Data".id

GROUP BY "Donor_Data".donation_frequency
ORDER BY COUNT("Donor_Data".second_language)DESC;

# Findings and Recommendations

There is a direct relationship between the ability to speak a second language and the
value/frequency
of donation. Donors who could speak a second language probably preferred the second language
to the first, and thus did not respond to emails or invitations to charity donations. Their job
fields cut across many sectors and thus if they are in a country different from where the charity
organization is situated and where another language they understand is spoken, there is a
tendency
that they will not respond to emails and invitations.
It is, therefore, necessary for the charity organization to provide translation tools within the email
for clients who may prefer to read their letters in a second language

More email marketing strategies and physical representation are needed in states that recorded
low donations. This will increase the donations received. In addition, more programs

should be organized for loyal donors, who share the vision of the charity organization and donate
daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Gift items should also be presented to them to show
appreciation and renew their commitment.

# Conclusion

The data shows that ability to speak a second language and a low level of education can
negatively affect the frequency and value of donations received.
